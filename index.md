# Welcome to Food Computing 

In the vibrant landscape of Indian cuisine, where diversity and complexity collide, the construction of a Food Knowledge Graph (FKG.in) represents a pioneering effort to harness and structure the immense variety of culinary data. The initiative aims to address significant gaps in the availability and organization of food-related information by focusing on the rich tapestry of Indian culinary traditions.

The FKG.in project is centered on building a comprehensive vocabulary and ontology tailored to Indian food. This involves not just the basic categorization of food items but extends to mapping out intricate relationships between different foods, their preparation methods, regional variations, and cultural significance.

Through advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the use of Large Language Models (LLM), the project populates a vast repository of Indian recipes. This ambitious endeavor aims to extract and ingest anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 recipes, forming the backbone of a robust knowledge graph. Additionally, the FKG.in provides a SPARQL Query Interface, facilitating sophisticated searches and enabling users to navigate this complex dataset efficiently.

#### Challenges in Designing the Indian Food Ontology
We target the following challenges in designing an ontology for Indian food, which reflect the broader complexities of Food Computing:

##### Sub-Comprehensive Vocabulary Development
The absence of a universally recognized and comprehensive vocabulary for Indian cuisine means starting from scratch is necessary. Indian food traditions are driven by social customs and regional practices, leading to a plethora of unique dishes and ingredients that are often poorly documented.

##### Multiplicity and Multilinguality
Many Indian recipes share ingredients but differ significantly in their preparation, reflecting regional tastes and methods. Additionally, the same ingredient or dish may be known by various names in different languages, adding layers of complexity to the data structuring process.

##### Food Homonyms and Measurement Standards
Common terms can refer to multiple, distinct items or concepts within the culinary domain, complicating data categorization. Moreover, traditional Indian cooking often eschews precise measurements in favor of qualitative descriptors, making standardization challenging.

##### Sociocultural Associations
Food items in India are often deeply intertwined with religious, cultural, and regional festivities, influencing how foods are perceived and consumed. Certain dishes are almost exclusively prepared during specific festivals or seasons, adding another dimension to how food data must be organized.

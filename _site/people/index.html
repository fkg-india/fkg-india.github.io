              <p><strong>Dr. Mayank Garg</strong> Mayank is a Simons Early Career Fellow at Ashoka University, pursuing quantitative health research to explore the heterogeneity of ICU disorders like Sepsis and ARDS. He is a physician scientist who completed his medical graduation and clinical training from IPGME&amp;R and SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India. He gained brief experience in intensive care before switching to experimental research at CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Delhi, India. He pursued a PhD here, working with murine models of Acute Lung Injury, dissecting the molecular mechanisms involved in inflammation. <br /> Realizing the importance of context in biomedical research, Mayank aims to derive mechanisms to leverage data science in a clinically relevant manner, and to validate them using contextual application of experimental models. He believes in the potential of digital transformation in personal empowerment, for improving health-care, sick-care, and clinical research. He is collaborating on a project to develop a digital framework to assist data collection and aid analysis for personalized lifestyle medicine. He plans to leverage the power of LLMs integrated with such digital frameworks for healthcare and healthcare research. He strongly advocates for collaborative growth and strict ethical standards as the foundation for advancing science.</p>

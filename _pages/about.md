    excerpt: "The **UC Irvine - Institute for Future Health (IFH)** aims to integrate lifestyle, community, environment, and social factors in conjunction with clinical knowledge to radically transform health systems away from hospitals and into the hands of each individual. Use power of data created by the nexus of knowledge of genetics and biology, sensors, mobile technology, knowledge-based AI systems, data management, and medical technology to empower people to be healthy. Use power of mobile phones to create personal health navigators that will power healthcare for everybody â€” the poorest people living in the remotest areas in the world. We convert Healthcare to become a popular Personal Health Navigation approach."

### Background

### Motivation

### Initial Groundwork

### Research

> <p style="font-size: 0.9em;"><b>Objective</b>: At the Food Computing Lab, we engage in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research at the intersection of Food Research, Large-Language Models, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, Data Mining, Analytics, and Software Engineering. Our lab draws from novel AI techniques, Machine Learning, and data science to study, understand, and analyze food by developing intelligent, scalable algorithms and methods that address sustainability, efficiency, and nutritional challenges in the global food supply chain.

> <p style="font-size: 0.9em;"><b>Focus</b>: To build a knowledge graph for Indian food that application of knowledge graphs to model complex relationships within food systems, from farm-to-table pathways to nutritional data and environmental impacts. These computational frameworks enable the integration and reasoning over vast datasets, providing insights that drive innovation in food production, safety, and sustainability.</p>

<p>This paper presents an ontology design along with knowledge engineering and multilingual semantic reasoning techniques to build an automated system for assimilating culinary information for Indian food in the form of <spano> FKG.in </spano> - a knowledge graph. The focus is on designing intelligent methods to derive ontology designs and capturing all-encompassing knowledge about food, recipes, ingredients, cooking characteristics, and most importantly, nutrition, at scale. We also describe the relevant challenges in curating knowledge of Indian food, propose our high-level ontology design, and present a novel workflow that uses AI, LLM, and language technology to curate information from recipe blog sites in the public domain to build knowledge graphs for Indian food. The design is application-agnostic and can be used for AI-driven smart analysis, building recommendation systems for Personalized Digital Health, and complementing the knowledge graph for Indian food with contextual information such as user information, food biochemistry, geographic information, agricultural information, etc.</p>

<p>This paper presents a novel approach to compute food composition data for Indian recipes using a knowledge graph for Indian food
(FKG.in) and LLMs. The main focus is to give a broad overview of an automated food composition analysis workflow and describe its core
functionalities viz. nutrition data aggregation, food Composition analysis, and LLM-augmented information resolution. This workflow aims
to complement FKG.in and supplement the food composition data from verified knowledge bases iteratively. This paper also highlights the challenges
in both representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally and delves into reviewing 3 sources of food composition
data viz. Indian Food Composition Tables, Indian Nutrient Databank, and Nutritionix API. Additionally, it briefly describes how users can interact
with the workflow to receive diet-based health recommendations and food composition information for innumerable recipes. We then discuss
the complex challenges in analyzing Indian recipe information along the axes of structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty and present our
ongoing work to discuss some LLM-based resolutions that could be used to address these challenges.</p>

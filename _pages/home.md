    excerpt: "Welcome to the **Food Computing Lab**! We strive to deepen our understanding of food and its intricate connections, including but not limited to *recipes, cooking, well-being, nutrition, dietary practices, agriculture, agrecology, misinformation, and heritage* - particularly in the **Indian context**. Our work emphasizes the importance of understanding food not only as a source of sustenance and enjoyment, but also as a vital component of a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. Using novel AI-driven computational technologies, we mine, curate and analyze data and relationships within food systems to uncover insights that enable *healthier eating habits, recipe generation, food recommendation, knowledge discovery, and informed decision-making*.

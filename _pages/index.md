    excerpt: "Welcome fellow researchers to the **Food Computing Lab**! We aim to deepen our knowledge of food and its intricate connections to *nutrition, cooking, recipes, dietary practices, well-being, society, and environment* - particularly in the **Indian context**. Our work emphasizes the importance of understanding food not only as a source of sustenance and enjoyment, but also as a vital component of a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. Using novel AI-driven computational technologies, we mine, curate and analyze data and relationships within food systems to uncover insights that enable *healthier eating habits, recipe generation, food recommendation, knowledge discovery, and informed decision-making*. To know more about our work, please browse our [research](/research/)."

> <p style="font-size: 0.9em;"><b>Key Problem Statement</b>: To address the prevalence and increasing threat of diet-related diseases like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes in India, it has become necessary to build frameworks for precisely tracking the dietary nutrition of food consumption among Indians. The recently proposed <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/83497.html">Personalized Health Navigators (PHN)</a> and <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/54960.html">Personalized Digital Health (PDH)</a> can provide an effective and efficient solution to these problems, provided adequate knowledge about Indian food and nutrition is digitally represented, available, and accessible alongside easy mechanisms to capture what people are eating regularly. We intend to create these platforms including but not limited to a comprehensive, granular, and dynamic database of Indian food at scale, an accompanying intelligent knowledge-based system for reasoning, and a recommendation system for personalized health navigation. And this is only the beginning!</p>

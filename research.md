    excerpt:  "**Ontology Design, Vocabulary Curation & Building, Validating, and Evaluating FKG.in**: The Food Knowledge Graph (FKG.in) project, aimed at constructing a robust knowledge graph for Indian food, has achieved significant milestones in academia and industry exposure. The project team led by Lipika Dey, Partha Pratim Das, alongside Ramesh Jain and Saransh Kumar Gupta, marked a notable presence with their work 'Building FKG.in a knowledge graph for Indian food,' which was the first paper accepted at the Joint Ontology Workshops co-located with FOIS 2024 in Enschede, The Netherlands. Furthermore, Prof. Lipika Dey's presentation at the University of Twente and Prof. Partha Pratim Das's lecture at the Institute for Future Health, UC Irvine, underscored the international academic interest and recognition in developing a comprehensive Indian food ontology. Saransh Kumar Gupta also expanded the project's visibility beyond its initial academic sphere with a well-received poster at the IISc, Bangalore, signaling a strong start outside the Ashoka ecosystem. These engagements collectively highlight FKG.inâ€™s growing impact on both national and international platforms, enhancing its credibility and outreach in the field of food knowledge integration."

**FKG Research Initiative: Advancing the Semantic Understanding of Indian Food Data**

At the Food Knowledge Graph (FKG) initiative, we focus on the development and enhancement of a comprehensive knowledge graph tailored for Indian cuisine. Our research efforts are directed towards creating robust ontologies, curating vocabularies, and building effective models to validate and evaluate FKG.in, ensuring it remains a leading resource in the domain.
